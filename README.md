Learning The Fundamentals Of React By Building A Roll Call App

Before we get started, in order to learn React, you'll have to already know some basics of html,css and javascript.

most of you might say that there's already the react documentation at https://reactjs.org/ so why the need for this tutorial.
Well, it is often said that the best way to learn something is to practice it, reading documentations always will get you stuck in 
tutorial hell. You need to build something with your knowledge and if that's what you want to do then you're in the right place.
This is a tutorial for beginners in React so I'm going to have a very interactive and lively tutorial.
